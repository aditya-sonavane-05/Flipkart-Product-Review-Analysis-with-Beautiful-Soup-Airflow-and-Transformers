15,Amit  Sankrani,Awesome piece of art to be used in Earth,"This is a master piece of the inventions from Apple. While you compare the previous versions of Iphone 6 and 6s, this is way ahead in terms of memory, speed and multitasking.

18,Saurabh Majumdar,i (for ideal) phone,"It would be presumptuous to not acknowledge that all those who pre-ordered this device, myself included, have done it simply for the allure of the latest iPhone. Even as I say this, I wasnt entirely convinced of the iPhone 7 when I watched the livestream of the Apple Keynote. However, a timely launch in India, less exorbitant pricing and a hefty cashback was what finally swung me in favour of it.
