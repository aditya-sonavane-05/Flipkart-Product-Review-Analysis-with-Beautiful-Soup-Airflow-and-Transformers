# Flipkart-Product-Review-Analysis-with-Beautiful-Soup-Airflow-and-Transformers

This project involves the creation of a data pipeline to extract customer reviews from Flipkart, transform the data, and perform sentiment analysis using Transformers. The pipeline is built using Python, Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, and AWS services for data storage and analysis.

## Project Overview

- **Data Extraction**: We use Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape customer reviews from Flipkart's website. The extracted data includes user reviews, ratings, and other relevant information.

- **Data Transformation**: The extracted data is processed and transformed into a suitable format for sentiment analysis. Any necessary cleaning and formatting operations are performed in this stage.

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Apache Airflow is utilized to create and manage the data pipeline. It schedules and automates the extraction, transformation, and analysis tasks. Airflow runs on an EC2 instance on AWS.

- **Data Storage**: The transformed data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, a highly scalable and durable storage solution. This allows for easy access to the processed data for analysis.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: The stored data is then used for sentiment analysis using Transformers or similar NLP models. This analysis helps in understanding customer sentiment and opinions from the reviews.
## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your AWS credentials and configure Apache Airflow according to the instructions in the `airflow/` directory.
3. Run the Apache Airflow DAG to execute the data pipeline.
4. Access the transformed data in the designated Amazon S3 bucket.
5. Utilize the data for sentiment analysis using Transformers or other NLP libraries.
